# Self-Improving-Leaderboard (SIL): A Call for Real-World Centric Natural Language Processing Leaderboards
The Self-Improving Leaderboard (SIL) represents a pioneering step in the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP) leaderboards, focusing on real-world applicability and continuous model improvement. This repository is dedicated to the Evolving Dataset component of SIL, which ensures that the leaderboard is powered by data that reflects the current and dynamic nature of language.

## Requirements
This project is tested and developed with Python 3.10. It is not compatible with Python 2.

Please ensure you are using Python 3.10 to avoid any compatibility issues.

## Installation
To get started with the SIL Evolving Dataset, you'll need to set up your environment properly. Here's how you can install the required packages:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd sil_evolving_dataset
```
## Usage
Once you have everything installed, you can start generating the evolving dataset using the provided scripts:

```bash
python generate.py
```

Running generate.py initiates the dataset generation process, pulling in fresh data from various sources and processing it to form the dataset that will be used in the SIL evaluations.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to the SIL Evolving Dataset project. Whether you have suggestions for improving the dataset, code enhancements, or new features, please feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

Thank you for supporting the SIL project and helping advance the field of natural language processing!
